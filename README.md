# Kohi

A game engine made using C

# Demo

Once there is actually something to show I'll provide a binary on every commit, for now just [build it yourself](#building) if you want to see a demo

# Building

This is a very complicated setup process that will take time and patience.

[Windows Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6_WdnzQIQ4&list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj&index=3)

[Linux Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIv1mygBOcg&list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj&index=4)

If your using linux, you need to change [scripts/build-all.sh](scripts/build-all.sh) line #8 to source the setup-env.sh file you downloaded

Once you have done all of the above, simply clone this project, open it in vscode, press control/command + shift + b to build the entire project, and press F5 to start running the project. Make sure to choose the right OS in the window on the sidebar.

# MacOS

I don't have a Mac to test on so Mac support won't be avalible. If you have a Mac and you would be willing to test and port this to Mac, I would be very grateful.
